                        JS OBJECTS

1. Collections of properties
2. Properties are a key-value pairs

const fitBitData = {
    totalSteps: 308727,
    totalMiles: 211.7,
    avgCalorieBurn: 5755,
    workoutsThisWeek: '5 of 7',
    avgGoodSleep: '2:13'
};

3. Accessing data 
    - fitBitData["totalSteps"] -> 308727
    better syntax - fitBitData.totalSteps

    *All keys are converted to strings, (except symbols)
    const years = {1999: 'good', 2020: 'bad'};
    years["1999"] works, years[1999] also works 

4. Difference between . and []
    - You can put an expression in the brackets
        fitBitData['total' + 'Miles'] => 211.7

    const years = {1999: 'good', 2020: 'bad'};
    let birthYear = 1999;

    years.birthYear //error
    years[birthYear] => 2020

5. You can add new key-value pairs using
    object.key = value

6. You can make an array of objects, or an object with an object inside of it
    or an object with arrays inside.

    const shoppingCart = [
        {
            product: 'Jenga Classic',
            price: 6.88,
            quantity: 3
        }, 
        {
            ...
        }
    ]
