                            STRINGS 
    -> indexing
    -> inbuilt funtions
        - str.length
        - "str"[0]
        - "lol" + "lol" - concatenation
        * We can't update one character at a time, we must reassign the variable.

        - 1 + "hi" = "1hi" (WTF)


    -> methods (built-in actions) 
        searching, replacing, upper/lower to lower/upper 
        string.method();
        non-destructive => the original string isn't changed.
        - str.toUpperCase() non-destructive
        - str.trim() [removes whitespaces in the beginning and end]
        
        - you can chain methods together 
            str.trim().toUpperCase()
        
        - str.indexOf("substring"), returns first occurence, -1 if not found
        - str.slice(beginIndex, endIndex(optional)); 
        - str.replace(what we want to replace, what we want to replace it with)

        - str.repeat(10)
            it will print the string 10 times

1. TEMPLATE LITERALS
    eg. "You bought " + qty + " " + product + ". Total is " + price*qty;
        very time-consuming.

    Solve this using template literals.

    `I counted ${3+4} sheep`; //"I counted 7 sheep"

    *THEY ONLY WORK WITH BACK-TICK CHARACTERS.

    `You bought ${qty} ${product}s. Total is $${price*qty}`; //to get a dollar sign 
    -> You can even call string methods inside these curly brackets.

2. NULL 
    -> intentional absence of any value
    -> must be explicitly assigned

    UNDEFINED 
    variables that are not assigned are by default set to undefined

3. Math Object
    Math.PI //3.14159265
    Math.round(4.9) //5
    Math.abs(-4) // 4
    Math.pow(2,5) //32
    Math.floor(3.999) //3

    Math.random() -> generates random number (0,1)

    Math.floor(Math.random()*m) -> to generate INTEGERS from 0 to m-1
