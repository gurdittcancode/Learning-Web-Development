<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
=== -> strict equality
!== -> strict inequality

1. You can compare strings, but it can get dicey. They are compared on the basis of Unicode.

2. == vs ===
    == checks for equality of value, but not equality of type.
        It coerces both values to the same type & and then compares them.
        1 == "1" ? true (wtf)
    
    === checks for equality of value AND type.

    *ALWAYS USE ===

-> console is an object, console.clear(), .time(), .warn(), .dir()

-> alert("ge4asd"), prompt("dfasd") => asks for input
