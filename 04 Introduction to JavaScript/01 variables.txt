                    INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT

#DON'T GET FRUSTRATED, JUST BE PATIENT

1. PRIMITIVE TYPES 
    -> Number
    -> String
    -> Boolean
    -> Null
    -> undefined
    * symbol
    * BigInt

2. At first we will write our code in Chrome dev tools
            The console is REPL
                    Read Evaluate Print Loop

3. JS has one 'number' type.
    - positive, negative, whole numbers, decimal numbers 
    - operations 
    - PEMDAS parentheses, expo, mul, div, add, sub
    - exponentiation 2**3 = 8

4. Not a Number (NaN)
    -> represents a number that is undefined
        eg. 0/0, 1 + NaN = NaN
    
    -> typeof 

5. Variables

    -> let variableName = value;
    
6. const & var 
    -> constant variable, you can't change it later on in the code. 

    -> VAR 
        It is the old way to declare variables, but there's no reason 
        to use it now.

** IN JAVASCRIPT, VARIABLES CAN CHANGE TYPES.
