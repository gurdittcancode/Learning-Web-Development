-> If we have arr = [1,2,3,4] and we do arr[10] = 10;
    the array will become [1,2,3,4, empty*5, 10].
    'empty' will be undefined

-> push => add to end
    pop => remove from end 
    shift => remove from start
    unshift => add to start

1. concat -> merge arrays 
    array3 = array1.concat(array2);
    original arrays aren't modified

2. array.includes() -> if an array includes a particular value
3. array.indexOf()
4. array.reverse() -> destructive method (changes the original)

5. array.slice() -> gets a copy of the slice of the array
6. array.splice() -> changes the contents of the array by removing or replacing
                    existing elements in place.

                    splice(start, delete count, value to be inserted);

7. array.sort() -> lol
                    - converts everything to strings and then compares their UTF-16 code.        
                    - doesn't really work
                    - create your own sorting function.
