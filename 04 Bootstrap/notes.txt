2. use a CDN
    Content Delivery Network it's a hosted stylesheet that we can access remotely

3. Put the link to Bootstrap above your style sheet so that your custom styles don't get 
    overidden.

4. There are also JS scripts that we should include if we want to use bootstrap with JS.

                        GRID SYSTEM
