                    BASICS

1. We can use Bootstrap remotely. It is a CDN (Content Distribution Network)
    Just link to the opening link.

2. Always link Bootstrap before your stylesheet, so that Bootstrap doesn't override your custom styles.

3. Boostrap has some JS components as well.

4. Bootstrap is used using classes.

5. Our code must be in a div with class "container."
6. responsive versions -> container-sm, container-md

7. YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEMORISE THIS, REFER TO THE DOCS. Just learn how to use it.

8. If you use button-groups, give the container a role="group" for screen readers

9. You need Bootstrap scripts to make dismissable alerts!
