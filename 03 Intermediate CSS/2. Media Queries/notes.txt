                    RESPONSIVE WEBSITES + MEDIA QUERIES

-> We create one website and design it to work on screens of different sizes.
-> Done using media queries
-> They allow us to modify our styles depending on screen-size, device type etc

@media(max-width: A px) {
    styles....
}

@media(min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {
    styles...
}

1. max/min-width
