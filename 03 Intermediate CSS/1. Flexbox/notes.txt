                        FLEXBOX

0. FOCUS ON CONCEPTS, NOT MEMORIZING THE PROPERTIES

1. display: flex;
    -> This turns on flexbox 


            ^
            |
            |
    <--------------------------MAIN AXIS----->
            |
            |   CROSS AXIS
            |
            
    -> By default, the main axis is LEFT TO RIGHT

2. flex-direction;
    -> Changes the direction of MAIN AXIS 
    -> by default it is 'row'
    -> 'row-reverse' makes it go RIGHT TO LEFT 

    -> 'column' main axis goes from TOP TO BOTTOM
    -> 'column-reverse'

*** FLEXBOX MAKES THE ELEMENTS FIT IN


3. JUSTIFY-CONTENT
    -> determines how content is distributed in the main axis
    -> by default, set to flex-start.
    -> flex-end, moves it to the end.
    -> center
    -> space-between, space-around, space-evenly


4. FLEX-WRAP
    -> determines if our content is going to wrap on our main axis 
        onto a new column/row 
    -> l->r or r->l is decided by direction of cross axis 
    -> 'wrap-reverse' changes direction of cross axis
    -> 'nowrap'

**FLEX-WRAP: WRAP-REVERSE CHANGES THE DIRECTION OF THE CROSS AXIS!!

5. ALIGN-ITEMS
    -> distributes spaces on the cross axis.
    -> flex-end, flex-start, center...
    -> 'baseline' aligns the text
