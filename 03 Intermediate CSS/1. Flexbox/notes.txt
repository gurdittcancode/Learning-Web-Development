                        FLEXBOX

0. Main axis (horizontal) and cross axis (vertical axis)
    by default, main is horizontal(l->r)

1. display: flex;
    
2. flex-direction
    -> changes the 'main' axis direction
        - row, row-reverse;
        - column, column-reverse;
    
    -> flexbox also makes elements squeeze in a space


3. justify-content
    -> how the content is distributed across the axis
    by default, justify-content: flex-start;
                                : flex-end;
                                : center; 
                                : space-between -> distributes space between 
                                  the elements but not on the outside
                                : space-around -> basically acts like margin
                                : space-evenly


4. flex-wrap: wrap;
    Determines if our content is going to wrap around the main axis onto a new line
    or a new column

    flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
    usually the cross axis is l->r, but now cross axis is r->l

    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    duh


5. align-items
    -> aligns items along cross axis (just like justify-content is for main axis)
    :flex-start -> top to bottom
    :flex-end;
    :center     -> you can center an element by setting j-c and align-items to center
