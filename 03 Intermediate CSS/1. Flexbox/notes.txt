                        FLEXBOX 

1. It determines how we distribute space within an element 

2. display: flex;
    -> This enables flexbox.

        ^
        |
    <--------main axis---------->
        |
        |   cross axis
        |

    -> by default, main axis goes l->r 

3. flex-direction 
    -> decides the direction of the main axis 
    -> default is 'row', row-reverse, column, column-reverse

    *flexbox makes the elements squeeze in if there isn't enough
        space*

4. justify-content;
    -> How the content is distributed in the main axis
    -> default is flex-start, flex-end, center
    -> space-between - all of the extra space is distributed BETWEEN the elements
    -> space-around - all extra space is distributed around and between the elements 
                        it's kinda like margin
    -> space-evenly - every space is even 

5. flex-wrap 
    -> Whether our content is going to wrap around the cross axis onto the next column 
        or row
    
    ****CHANGES DIRECTION OF CROSS AXIS

    -> 'wrap' will wrap it along the cross axis (l->r)
    -> 'wrap-reverse', 'nowrap'

6. align-items 
    -> Distribute items along the CROSS axis.
    -> 'flex-end', 'flex-start' (default), 'center', 'baseline' - we can align items according to the baseline of our text


7. align-content
    -> controls space between rows/columns along cross axis ONLY when we have multiple rows/columns.
    -> 'space-between', 'flex-start'

8. align-self
    -> controls the alignment of an individual element.
