** HTML IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, IT'S JUST A MARKUP LANGUAGE
   eg: make this BOLD, make this italicised, add an image here etc.
   (imagine you wrote an essay, and your teacher is suggesting these things)

   you don't NEED to write the boiler-plate code, your broswer will recognise it as HTML
   but that is fundamentally wrong.

1. <title> shows what will be displayed in the browser tab.

2. h1, h2, h3, h4 - heading tags (decreasing order of size)
   - <b> is bold tag or "bring attention to" tag

3. <ul> is unorered list (bullet points)
   - <ol> is ordered list (1,2,3,4...)
   - <li> is list item
   - you can have nested lists

4. <a> is link tab
   -href="google.com" (if you click on the link it will go to the href)
   - add link text between opening and closing tag


5. <p> and heading tags are block elements, img and <a> are inline elements

6. <img src="" alt=""> 
   - no closing tag 
   - src is the source of the image, alt is the text that will appear if 
     picture gets deleted/unavailable or if someone is using a screenreader


7. <sup> superscript
   <sub> subscript

8. <html> should only have head and body tags inside
   - all the content goes inside the body tag.
   - CSS, JS, information about the website goes in the head tag

9. A WEB PAGE SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE <h1> TAG !!!

10. Sometimes you want to put in elements which are not available on your keyword
   eg. certain symbols, so for them we use entity codes

   eg &#9824; this is the entity code for spades from a deck of cards
      or &spades;

   -they are used in place of characters which may be invalid
   eg. &, <

   - start with an ampersand(&) and end with a semicolon (;)
   - the broswer interprets them and renders them to show the characters


11. <div> is a container which groups elements together

12. A div is just a generic container, it doesn't express any meaning. To
    help in SEO, screen readers, improving accessibility etc, use semantic elements like
    <nav>
    <header>
    <footer>
    <section>
    <article>
    they are exactly like divs but their name tells us what elements
    they contain. This will help when you want to change something
    in your website (if you want to change the footer, look 
    for <footer> etc...). You can use them interchangeably, because after
    *they are all just divs*, but some names might be more meaningful 
    depending on the situation.

13. <nav> used for navigation links
   <section> just represents a section
   <article> they should have a heading, represent sections etc
   <aside> tangential and non-essential stuff (sidebars, notes, etc.)
   <header> introductory content, sometimes have links for logins etc
   <footer> it is present at the end of the page
   both headers and footers have nested <nav> elements
   <time> contains date and time (duh)
   <figure> usually a diagram/figure with a caption
   <data> .....

14. Emmet is a built-in support in VS Code which helps you write snippets
   for HTML

15. <br> is line break (goes to the next line)
   <hr> is horizontal rule (line which goes across the screen), no closing tag for <hr>
