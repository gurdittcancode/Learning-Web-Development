********************** MANIPULATION ****************************

We'll only study the important ones because there are 100s of properties and methods.

1. innerText, textContent and innerHTML

    *innerText => text inside the opening and closing tags. It shows what the user will see.
    *textContent => It's just like innerText, BUT it has weird spaces, which come from the markup.
                    It shows all the text, even what is hidden.

    *innerHTML => Shows the HTML under the hood.

    You can use += syntax like
    document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML += '<sup>lol is this working</sup>'
    as it is an object!!


2. Working with attributes

    *getAttribute()
    *setAttribute(what we want to change, new value)
