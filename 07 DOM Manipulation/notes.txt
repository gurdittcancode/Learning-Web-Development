Document Object Model

-> A javascript representation of a webpage, plus tons of useful methods and properties.
-> It's a bunch of objects you can interact with via JS

DOCUMENT object 

- Every HTML and CSS element gets a JS object.
- hierarchial relationship depending on how they're declared (like a tree)
- At the top, there is 'Document.' It's an object which contains all the content on a page + properties

console.dir(document)
    -> this allows you to see the element as a javascript object (shows properties of everything.)
