                    SELECTING ELEMENTS [select -> manipulate]

1. getElementById()
    getElementByTagName()
    getElementByClassName()

    -> We pass a string, and if an element corresponding to that is found, its object is created
        and then returned. Otherwise it's null
    -> We can store them in variables.
