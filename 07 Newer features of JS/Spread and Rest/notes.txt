                            SPREAD

eg. Math.max(1,2,3,4) = 4
    Math.min(1,2,3,4) = 1
    const arr = [1,2,3,4]

    Math.max/min(arr) = undefined (expects list of arguments)

    Spread syntax "spreads" the array out where it is expected

    Math.min(...arr) = 1 

    -> can do this with strings as well


1. Spread with Array literals
    const cats = ["Blue", "Scout", "Rocket"]
    const dogs = ["Rusty", "Wyatt"]

    const allPets = [...cats, ...dogs, "Speedy"]

2. Just like with arrays
    const feline = {legs: 4, family: "Felidae"}
    const canine = {isFurry: true, family: "Caninae"}

    const catDog = {...feline, ...canine}
    When there is a conflict of properties, the one declared later will win

    const obj = {...[2,4,6,8]}
    obj = {0: 2, 1: 4, 2: 6: 3: 8}


                        ARGUMENT OBJECT

- Available inside every function
- it's an array-like object.
    has a length property, does not have array methods like push, pop

- stores all the arguments passed to a function
- not available in arrow functions

eg, Math.min() accepts any number of arguments


solution:               REST

Collects all remaining arguments and puts them in an actual array
