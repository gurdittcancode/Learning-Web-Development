1. FUNCTION CALL STACK
    > latentflip.com/loupe
    > Dev Tools
        1. Go to Sources
        2. Select your script
        3. Add a breakpoint in your code (pauses your code execution)
        4. Refresh 
        5. Click on the up and down arrows and observe the 'call stack' section.

2. JS IS SINGLE-THREADED
    > At any given point, Js can only run one line of code.
    > If we write a program that takes 5 seconds to run, does nothing happen in my code for 5 seconds?
        Does everything stop for that duration?

    > NO 

    console.log("Sending request to server");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Here is your data...");
    }, 5000);
    console.log("End of file");

    o/p ->     Sending request to server
                End of file
                Here is your data...


    WHY??
    > The browser does the work. They are written in languages like C++.
    >  Browsers come with WebAPIs that are able to handle certain tasks in the background like setTimeout and making
        server requests etc..
    > Javascript recognizes these WebAPI functions and passes them off to the browser to take care of and continues with its
        normal execution.
    > Once the browser finishes that task, it's returned to Javascript.

    WORKAROUND
    > Use callback functions.
