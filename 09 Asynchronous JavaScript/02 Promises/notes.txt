    Promises are pretty new

> A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an operation.

> Conventionally, we pass a success and failure callback in a request, which makes our code 
    very nested. Only one of them will run.

PROMISE - pending
        - rejected
        - resolved

> You can attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks to the function.
    They will run depending on if the promise got rejected or resolved.

.then() -> runs if promise is resolved
.catch() -> runs if promise is rejected

Till now, they don't seem like an improvement over callbacks.

The magic -
    You can chain .then()s by returning the promises
