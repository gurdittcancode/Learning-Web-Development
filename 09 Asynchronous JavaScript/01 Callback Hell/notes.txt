To delay it we have 2 methods 
> setTimeout, and add delays
    to change color at an interval of 1 second, we have to write delays as 1000, 2000, 3000... (math >:( )

> Nested setTimeout
    But nesting can get absolutely crazy and our code can get very deep and nested (Callback Hell)

But we need some mechanism to pause the code execution, because Javascript delegates stuff to browsers and moves on

THIS IS SOLVED USING 'PROMISES' AND 'ASYNC'
