1. IMPORTING STYLES

    - we could write <h1 style="color: purple"> Hello</h1>
        but this is a bad practice, as we cannot share them without 
        writing the same code again

    - style element
        <style> 
            h2 {
                color: pink;
            }
        </style>

        again, we can't share the styles among different files

    - best approach
        write your styles in an external style sheet

        to connect your HTML and CSS files -> <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 

2. SOME ATTRIBUTES

    color: changes text color
    background-color: duh
    background: is a generalised form of background-color, it can do a lot more
    

3. COLOURS---

    a) RGB
       - each value is between 0 & 255 
       - eg, rgb(255,0,0)
    
    b) HEXA
        - 16-based codes
            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

            eg, #ff ff 00
                red green blue
                ff = 255

        - if we have #000000, we can also short-hand it as #000
                    #CC55EE; we can write c5e;
