1. TEXT PROPERTIES

    a) text-align -> horizontal alignment with an element
                    - controls how the text is aligned within an element (inline/block)
                    - width: 50% (the block element will now take up 50% of the web page)
                            


    b) font-weight -> controls the boldness/lightness of text
                        normal, bold, lighter
                        100, 200,...900
                        400 = normal, 700 = bold

                    if a font-weight doesn't exist for a font, 
                    the browser will choose the closest one
    
    c) text-decoration -> - controls the appearance of lines on a text (underline, overline, strike-through)
                        - we can specify the colour as well
                        - dotted, solid, dashed, wavy
                        - we can also remove the default underlines under links
                            by setting text-decoration to "none"
    
    d) line-height -> controls vertical line spacing

    e) letter-spacing -> duh
                        
    f) font-size -> we have a lot of units
                    small medium large, %ages, pixels etc.

                    px -> most commonly used absolute unit
                        - 1px is not necessarily equal the width of exactly 1 pixel!
                        - not recommended for responsive websites
