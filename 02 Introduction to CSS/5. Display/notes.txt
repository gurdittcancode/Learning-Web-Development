    Inline-Block

    display: inline - it can make block level elements behave like inline elements

    - inline elements -> width, height are ignored
                      -> padding is respected, but it does not displace the rest 
                            of the content, it just lies on top of it.
                      -> margin is respected only in the same line
            
    - block elements -> everything is respected

    To solve this, we use inline-block for inline elements
        -> They behave like inline elements, but everything is respected (like with block-level elements)

    - set display: none; to hide an element from the page (it's not deleted, it's there in the doc)
