                    UNITS

Absolute units: px, cm, in, mm
Relative units: %, em, rem

1. PERCENTAGE
    - width: 50% -> half the width of parent element

    - sometimes, it's a percentage of the element, not the parent
        eg. line-height: 50% -> it's 50% of the font-size of the element
                                not the parent


2. EMs
    - font-size: 1em -> same font-size as parent
                2em -> twice the font-size of parent

    - with padding & margin, 1em equals the font-size of the ELEMENT

    - with pixels, we can't scale an element, because it's an absolute 
        unit. That's why we use relative units, so that they maintain their
        proportions.
    

3. REMs
    - shortcoming of em
        -> if we have nested lists for example, and we use ems, if you change
            the size of the outermost list, the units will stack and increase/decrese
            the size of everything nested inside it.
    
    - solution-> REMs
    
    Root-EMs
    Relative to root html element size
    - if root font-size is 20px, 1rem is ALWAYS 20px

    html {              /* changing the root font-size
    font-size: 10px;
}


4. EMs are useful when you want to scale properties eg, border radius
