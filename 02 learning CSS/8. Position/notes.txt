                        POSITION

It determines how an element is positioned in a document. The 
top, bottom, left, & right properties determine the final position.

1. position: static;
    default
    top, right, bottom, left and z-index have no effect.

2. position: relative;
    keeps the element in the flow of the document, but we can offset it 
    relative to itself.
    we can use negative values to offset in the other direction

3. position: absolute;
    the element is removed from the flow of the document and no space is given 
    to it. 
    it's positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (anything other than static), if it doesn't 
    exist, it's positioned relative to the body. 

4. position: fixed;
    It's like absolute, but it's position will STAY relative to that containing block
    even if we scroll down/up, it'll maintain its top,left etc

    Can be used in navigation bars like on some websites

5. position: sticky;
    it starts out in its position, but if we scroll and it hits the top and then it gets fixed
