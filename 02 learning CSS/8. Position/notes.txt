                        POSITION

1. Establishes how "top", "bottom", "left", "right" work. 

2. position: static;
    - default
    - top, bottom, left and right have no effect

3. position: relative;
    - element follows the normal flow of the document, but we 
        can offset it relative to itself
    - if we say top: 100px, it will push it down 100px from its original
        position, doesn't move anything else around. We can also put -ve values
        to move in the opposite direction.

4. position: absolute;
    - element is removed from the document flow and no space is created for the
        element.
    
5. position: fixed;
    - the element is fixed to the web page, and it will not move, even if we scroll
