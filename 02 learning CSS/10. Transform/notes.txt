                                TRANSFORMS

- rotate things, scale, stretch them, move them etc

* margin: auto
    with a block level element, if left and right margins are auto
    they are centered in their container.

1. Rotate 
    - angles -> deg, rad (most common), turns

    transform-origin -> control the point about which it rotates
    rotateX() -> rotates about X axis
    rotateY()
    rotateZ()

2. Scale 
    changes size of element
    scaleX() 
    scaleY()

3. Translate 
    move around an element
    translateX()
    translateY()
    length or some percentage (rems, ems, px)
    negative values work as well

4. Skew
    skewX()
    skewY()


- You can apply all of them at the same time by separating them by spaces.
- Everything inside an element is affected by the transforms.
