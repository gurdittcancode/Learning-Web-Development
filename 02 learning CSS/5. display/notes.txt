                    DISPLAY
    - inline
    - block
    - inline-block

    display: inline can make a block element an inline element :O !!
    display: block bruh

    if an element is inline, 
    - height and width are ignored
    - padding doesn't displace other elements, it just sits on top of
        it. it doesn't act as a "force field" (doesn't push everything else away)
    - margin is respected horizontally, but completely ignored vertically

    if an element is block, everything is respected


    INLINE-BLOCK 

    - it behaves like an inline element, but width height margin and padding are respected
    
    display: none; hides the element
