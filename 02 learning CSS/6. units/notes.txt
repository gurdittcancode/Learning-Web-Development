                    UNITS

1. relative: em, rem, vh, vw, % - very common
    absolute: px, in, mm, cm

    - percentage
        in reference to the parent element
        - sometimes, they work in comparison to text etc (line-height)

    - em's 
        1em = font-size of the parent
        2em = twice the size

        with margins, 1 em is not equal to the font-size to the parent
                    it is equal to the font size of the element
                
        article {
            font-size: 20px;
        }
        h2 {
            font-size: 5em;
            margin-left: 1em;
        }         

        font-size = 5*20 = 100px
        margin-left= 1em= 100px

        another fault in pixels - it's an absolute unit 
                                doesn't scale well when we increase size
