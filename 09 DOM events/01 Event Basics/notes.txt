3 ways to listen for events

1. Inline events (don't do this!)

    <button onclick="alert('you clicked me!')">

    > It complicates our markup
    > It's annoying
    > Difficult to write multiple lines
    > If we want similar behaviour for another button, we have to copy-paste 
        the entire markup.
        - changing the message (ugh)


2. Get the button element using querySelector and change the 'onclick' property 
    to a function. Better, but not as optimal.


3. BEST METHOD -> addEventListener()
    Go to MDN and check out different types of events.
    btn3.addEventListener('event', callback function)

    Why is it better?

    > In second method, it's treated as a property. Only one value, we can't have > 1 
        callback functions. We can do that using addEventListener()
    
    > You can add 'options' 
        {once: true} sirf ek baar chalega, after that it removes the eventListener
