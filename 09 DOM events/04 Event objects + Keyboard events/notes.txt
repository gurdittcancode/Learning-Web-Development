1. When you trigger an event, an 'Event object' is automatically created and passed into our callback.
    That event object has all the information about the event that was fired.

2. When we are dealing with keyboard events and we want to know what key was pressed, that 
    information in the keyboardEvent object.

    keydown, keyup -> event is fired if ANY key is pressed

    evt.key = gives pressed key
    evt.code = gives its code

    > If you care about the POSITION of the keys, use code because it stays the same across 
        different languages
    > If you care about the key, use key
