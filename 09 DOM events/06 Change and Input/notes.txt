Change and Input events
> When we want something to happen live, not on submit etc.
> keydown, but that excludes other stuff (copy paste etc)

-> CHANGE event fires when we *click away* after changing the value in an input.
    (blur the input)

-> INPUT event fires whenever what's in the input changes.

JUST PRESSING ARROW KEYS/SHIFT/CONTROL OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH DOESN'T CHANGE THE INPUT WON'T TRIGGER THESE EVENTS.

-> If you console.log(evt) in the input event,
    evt.data will tell you what new key was pressed.
