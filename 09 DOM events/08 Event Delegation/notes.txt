If you add an eventListener to some li's that were existing on your page
and you add some li's using javascript, the eventListener won't be added to the new lis.

Solved using Event Delegation

Attach the eventListener to the parent. But we still need to find out WHICH li was clicked.
const ul = document.querySelector('ul');

ul.addEventListener('click', (evt) => {
    evt.target.remove();
})

evt.target shows which element was clicked before the event was fired.
