1. Purpose of 'action' in forms
    > It moves the data to that location
    > We move to a new page

    What if we want to stay on that same page? On all websites, when you submit some data, the page doesn't refresh 
    or go to another address. How do we do that?

    event.preventDefault(); prevents the default behaviour of a given event.

2. input.value
    At any time, we can ask what is currently in the input
    > can set it to ''
