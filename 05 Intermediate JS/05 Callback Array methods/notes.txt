These accept functions as arguments

                        FOR-EACH

Calls the function once per element in the array.
Not used a lot, because we have for...of


                        MAP

Creates a new array with results of calling a callback on every element in the array.


                        ARROW FUNCTIONS 

Newer alternative to writing functions, we don't have to write 'function'.
Used to create function expressions

const add = (x, y) => {
    return x+y;
}

-> if there is no argument, ()
-> if there is ONLY a single parameter, () are optional

Implicit return (only with arrow functions)

    - You don't need to write 'return'
    - use normal brackets instead of curly braces.
    - if the function body is really simple, you can skip the brackets as well (use your judgement.)
