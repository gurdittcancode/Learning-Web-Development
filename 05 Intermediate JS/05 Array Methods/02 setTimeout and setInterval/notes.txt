                        setTimeout 

-> Add a delay in your code execution
-> setTimeout(a callback, delay duration)

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("HELLOO!!)
}, 3000) 

3000ms

                        setInterval

-> calls the function every 'x' seconds
-> to stop the execution:
    an id is generated by setInterval and we can say clearInterval(id) to stop it.
    const id = setInterval(greet, 300)
    after a certain number of iterations, write clearInterval(id) and it will stop.
    

                        Filter

- creates a new array with all elements that return true for the given function
- original array is unchanged
