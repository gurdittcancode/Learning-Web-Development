1. HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS 
    They can accept other functions as arguments
            return a function


    function callTwice(func) {
    func();
    func();
}

function rollDie() {
    const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    console.log(roll);
}

callTwice(rollDie); DO NOT PUT rollDie() otherwise it will run it.

                            METHODS

-> A method is just a function that has been placed as a property of an object.
-> dot syntax

    every method is a function, but not vice versa

const math = {
    multiply: function(x,y) {
        return x*y;
    },
    divide: function(x,y) {
        return x/y;
    }
}

-> SHORTHAND
    const math = {
        blah: "HI!",
        add(num, nums) {
            return num + nums;
        },

        square(num) {
            return num*num;
        }
    }

-> "THIS" KEYWORD

    works just like 'this' in OOPS.
    Its value depends on how the function is called.
    i.e. cat.meow(), meow will be called in the context of cat object
        const meow2 = cat.meow
        meow2() -> will be called in reference to Window object (top-most object);
